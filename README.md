Hey there! I am a passionate self-taught software developer with a high affinity for learning new technologies and applying them to new projects and environments.

Being able to see the outcome of my work and the impact it has to my users is one of the things I enjoy most.

I find the problem solving and challenging nature of software development exciting. I am entralled by coming up with new software project ideas, applying new technologies and discovering how things work.
